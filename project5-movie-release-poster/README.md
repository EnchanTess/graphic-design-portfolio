We created movie posters for the release of Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker! 
They hung in our local movie theatre the month the movie released, and I have a picture somewhere of myself in front of it!

This project was really fun, I played with line work and lighting and love how it turned out. 
That said, looking back I would make a few changes, but for my first project of this type I am pleased with it.
